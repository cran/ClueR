\title{Run CLUster Evaluation}
\usage{
runClue(Tc, annotation, rep = 10, kRange, clustAlg = "cmeans",
  effectiveSize = c(5, 100), pvalueCutoff = 0.05, alpha = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{Tc}{a numeric matrix to be clustered. The columns correspond to the time-course and the rows correspond to phosphorylation sites.}

\item{annotation}{a list with names correspond to kinases and elements correspond to substrates belong to each kinase.}

\item{rep}{number of times the clustering is to be applied. This is to account for variability in the clustering algorithm.}

\item{kRange}{the range of k to be tested for clustering.}

\item{clustAlg}{the clustering algorithm to be used. The default is cmeans clustering.}

\item{effectiveSize}{the size of annotation groups to be considered for calculating enrichment. Groups that are too small
or too large will be removed from calculating overall enrichment of the clustering.}

\item{pvalueCutoff}{a pvalue cutoff for determining which kinase-substrate groups to be included in calculating overall enrichment of the clustering.}

\item{alpha}{a penalty factor for penalizing large number of clusters.}
}
\value{
a clue output that contains the input parameters used for evaluation and the evaluation results. Use ls(x) to see details of output. 'x' be the output here.
}
\description{
Takes in a time-course matrix and test for enrichment of the clustering using cmeans or kmeans clustering algorithm with a reference annotation.
